Given some text, give the relationships between the Entities provided only. 
Only use the entities from the entities list. If both SOURCE and TARGET are not
in the entities list, do not include a relationship in the output.

Respond with a comma separated list of {SOURCE \\  PERFORMED_ON \\ TARGET } triples.

Here are some examples:

Text: Use a 3/8'' socket to remove the bolt and replace the engine.
Entities: [remove/ACTIVITY, bolt/ITEM]
A: [{remove \\ PERFORMED_ON \\ bolt}]

Text: Put the shifter in neutral, turn the engine off, and engage the emergency brake.
Entities:[put/ACTIVITY, shifter/ITEM, engage/ACTIVITY, emergency brake/ITEM]
A: [{put \\ PERFORMED_ON \\ shifter}, {engage \\ PERFORMED_ON \\ emergency_brake}]




Reduced version:

Given some text, give the PERFORMED_ON relationship between the entities provided only.
 If both SOURCE and TARGET are not in the entities list, do not give a relationship for it.
Respond with a comma separated list of {SOURCE,TARGET} tuples.
Here are some examples:
Text: Use a 3/8'' socket to remove the bolt and replace the engine.
Entities: [remove/ACTIVITY, bolt/ITEM]
A: [{remove,bolt}]
Text: Put the shifter in neutral, turn the engine off, and engage the emergency brake.
Entities:[put/ACTIVITY, shifter/ITEM, engage/ACTIVITY, emergency brake/ITEM]
A: [{put,shifter}, {engage,emergency_brake}]
